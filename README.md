Based on experience gained during the implementation of previous projects (within a scientific group) associated with developing a computer vision systems such as “a monitoring and analysis of plant growth system” and “an active detection and the disturbance of birds system”, an attempt was made to create a computer vision system which make able to estimate granulometric composition of granular mass (i.e. wood chips and pellets). The aim of the work is also review of usefulness of tools such as programming languages , libraries, algorithms, methods and tools of image acquisition in developing this type of vision systems. Design assumptions state that the vision system to perform image processing and analysis of the separated granular masses, are recorded online by digital camera or digital camcorder or downloaded from files. Gained information are able to export to common software to their statistical analysis. Also designed a prototype test bench compatible with the other elements of designed vision system.
